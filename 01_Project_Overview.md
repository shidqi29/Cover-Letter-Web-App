# Cover Letter Web App - Project Overview

## RUP (Rational Unified Process) Methodology

### Project Overview

This document outlines the project overview for the Cover Letter Web Application, developed as part of a thesis project using the Rational Unified Process (RUP) methodology.

### System Description

The Cover Letter Web Application is an AI-powered web application that automates the creation of personalized cover letters by intelligently analyzing job postings and user CVs/resumes. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, the system leverages OpenAI's advanced language models to extract information from various input formats and generate professional, tailored cover letters. The application features a comprehensive template system with visual previews, quality assessment indicators, real-time content streaming, and multi-format document generation capabilities.
